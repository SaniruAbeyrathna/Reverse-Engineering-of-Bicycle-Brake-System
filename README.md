# Reverse-Engineering-of-Bicycle-Brake-System
For the componets of brake system we conducted material analysis and used Autodesk Fusion 360 for 3D modelling. My contributions include reverse engineering and designing the brake lever and its injection mold, generating 2D engineering drawings, and improving lever durability through material selection and design optimization.
